# Laptop Price Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various laptop features such as RAM, weight, display properties, and brand, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a laptop.
Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the price of a laptop given its unique set of features. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to empower users with a tool that simplifies the process of evaluating and understanding the pricing dynamics within the laptop market.

## Key Features
Our predictive model takes into account a wide range of laptop features, including but not limited to:

* RAM: The amount of memory available for processing tasks.
* Weight: The physical weight of the laptop, impacting portability.
* Processor: The type and performance of the central processing unit (CPU).
* Display Characteristics: Features such as touchscreen capability, IPS technology, and Pixels Per Inch (PPI).
* Storage: The presence and capacity of both Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD).
* Graphics Card: The type and power of the laptop's graphics processing unit (GPU).
* Operating System: The software environment that facilitates user interaction.
